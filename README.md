# text2tac
text2tac converts text to tactics

# installation 

The python `text2tac` package can be installed with `pip install` in a standard way from git repo (we aren't yet on pypi.org). For developers a recommended way is `pip install -e .` from the cloned source repository which allows to develop directly on the source of the installed package. Our key (recommended/tested) pip dependencies are `python>=3.9`.
